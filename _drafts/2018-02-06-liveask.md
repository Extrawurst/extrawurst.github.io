# Intro

[live-ask.com](www.live-ask.com) is a little website project I worked on every once in a while lately. The idea is to provide a simple, free and realtime service to moderate panel discussions, conference presentations, meetups, heck basically everything where a someone wants to moderate a discussion discussion.

# What to expect

This post kicks off a series of posts about my journey through modern web technology lately:

* My tech stack: VADA (this post)
* Angular
* Docker
* CD with Gitlab CI
* AWS - moving to the cloud
* Make it look great
* Animating lists in Angular
* The day angular was broken
* Automated unittests with Angular

For now this is the broad roadmap of how I think it makes sense to split it up into digestable pieces. But lets see where we go from here.

# VADA Stack - 'i am your father'

What the hell is VADA?

* V - Vibe.d - the server framework ([vibed.org](http://vibed.org/))
* A - AWS - the hosting platform ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/))
* D - Dlang - in the backend ([dlang.org](https://dlang.org/))
* A - Angular - in the frontend ([angular.io](https://angular.io/))

I know AWS is not a database that you would usually find in a stack like this, but I could not come up with any accronym that works with DynamoDB and therefore 3 'D's.

# V as in Vibe.d

# A as in AWS

# D as in the D programming language

# A as in Angular
