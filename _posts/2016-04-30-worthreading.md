The following stuff is what caught my eye in the last couple of weeks. Consider these kind of posts as an entry in my personal knowledge base ;)

###Tools: oh my zsh

Great tool to have a an extendended and improved feature set on the shell in osx: zsh with iterm. I use them both now for months successfully and do not want to miss them, it looks better and is a lot more powerful:

###GDC: "Story of making Diablo" by David Brevik

###Podcast: JS Jabber with Marcus Blankenship on "Growing Happy Developers"

I really enjoyed this podcast about how to make your employee developers happy, how to be a good boss. I think a lot more focus should be put into discussing these topics, because there is nothing more important than being a boss that your developers like to work with:

###Podcsat: SE Radio with Fred George on "Developer Anarchy"

Fred George has the opportunity to be working in a field where your software product can be deployed in a fast paced manner and get feedback equally rapid (online advertising). In this podcast he talks about what changes this brings to the agile process and how well a managerless approach works here. He agrassively calls it "developer anarchy". Unfortunately this does not fit all:

###Tweet: Ebay starts looking into D
