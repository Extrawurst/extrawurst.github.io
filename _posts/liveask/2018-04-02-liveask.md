# Intro

[live-ask.com](https://www.live-ask.com) is a small website project I worked on lately. The idea is to provide a simple, free and realtime service to moderate panel discussions, conference presentations, meetups, heck basically everything where someone wants to moderate a discussion.

# Background

I am the organizer of one of the biggest meetup groups in Hamburg, Germany - the [Hamburg Unity Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-Unity-Meetup/)!
With over 530 members we organized more than 8 events since the founding in 2016.

The initial format was to have two speakers a night, snacks and drinks to do some networking and hanging out afterwards. Due to decreasing attandence rates we wanted to revitalize the event by setting up a discussion panel with audience driven topics.

We assembled a round of great speakers from different fields: Games, Indie, Education, Corporate consulting and more. Altogther we sat down and wondered "ok what if the audience does not come up with questions?". 

To have a preset of questions that might be interesting we gathered ideas and topics to fill more than a whole evening. With that at hand I was wondering how to share this now upfront with the crowd?

With our questions written down in our wiki I was looking for tools that would allow me to share this list with our audience upfront. The [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) event page just allows you to share a file not more. But I kept wondering if there was a more interactive option:

* Why not allow everyone to add questions to it? 
* Let people vote on what topics they like

Not finding such a tool I shared the list statically upfront.

During the meetup I made up my own priorities and asked the questions in that order. The audience was very active and asked their questions but I also got a lot of valuable feedback afterwards:

* People said some topics were not interesting to them
* Others were starting discussions on topics they did not raise during the panel

# live-ask

This meetup experience made me create live-ask.com. I wanted to solve all those issues and have a platform that I can easily create an event in and share it with people that can contribute with topics or questions they like to see discussed. You can vote on those to make sure things get tackled in the right priority and no one has to stand up in front of a huge crowd and grab a mic to participate, its all online, cross-platform and interactive.

Look at how the resulting example for the original unity meetup would have looked like on live-ask.com:
