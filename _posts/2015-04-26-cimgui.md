So I needed a flexible and easy to use [intermediate GUI](http://www.johno.se/book/imgui.html) for one of my projects in D. There was a pretty descent library natively written in D called [dimgui](https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/dimgui) that I started to use. It made me fall in love with the simple concept of an IMGUI but I was soon wanting more features than this library provided. 
I started looking around for something similar but more mature. I found [IMGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) written in C++ but with a very simple C-like interface. I wrote a c-wrapper [cimgui](https://github.com/Extrawurst/cimgui) for it and afterwards added bindings for the D programming lanugage in a [derelict-like](https://github.com/DerelictOrg) style.

See the original imgui example below in a D application:

This is a screenshot of my user interface written in it:

You can find the example project in D here: [imgui_d_test](https://github.com/Extrawurst/imgui_d_test)
