I want to use this way to announce some news that I did not have the time to blog about. These news divide esentually in two categories: career and projects update:

##Career Update:

Since August 2015 I am back to the games industry! After an intermezzo as a consultant I am now a Team Lead Software Developer at [InnoGames](https://www.innogames.com/) in Hamburg, Germany. I love to be back in this vibrant and challenging branche. 

I am lucky and have the opportunity to lead my team from the ground up in a whole new and exciting project. If you are an experienced Unity3D Developer or Java Backend Developer and you would like to work with me please drop me a line or find infos on these jobs here: [InnoGames Careers](http://corporate.innogames.com/de/career/jobs.html)

##Project Updates:

There are also some new open source efforts that maybe of interest:

####[bgfxd-examples: bgfx examples ported to D](https://github.com/Extrawurst/bgfxd-examples)
I started to like [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) a lot and since there are [D bindings](https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictBgfx) I tried to learn using it by porting the official examples to D. I did not finish a lot yet but it is an ongoing process.

####[file2d: create embedable files in/for D](https://github.com/Extrawurst/file2d)
This little helper was designed to create embedable binary files for D. You can pass in any file and it will be read as binary and converted to a module containing a symbol that contains this files content as a hex string like this:
{% highlight d %}
static immutable ubyte[1234] = [0x12, ...];
{% endhighlight %}

####[FMOD D Bindings](https://github.com/Extrawurst/DerelictFmod)
I created and maintain [FMOD](http://www.fmod.org/) bindings for the D programming language for a couple of months now but I only recently added a simple but illustrative application on how to actually use it in D. See the example app [here on github](https://github.com/Extrawurst/DerelictFmod/blob/master/source/app.d)

Actually it uses a freeware sound converted to compile time string using file2d mentioned above (and it is this usecase for which i created file2d)

####[Steamworks D Bindings](https://github.com/Extrawurst/DerelictSteamworks)
I also created Steamworks SDK bindings a couple of months back already. The first version of the SDK that was supported is 1.34 since it was the first that included the c-api that I am binding. The Bindings include a simple demo app too to demonstrate on how to use the API.
