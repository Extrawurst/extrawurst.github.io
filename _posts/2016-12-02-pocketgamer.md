Some time ago I was asked to write an article about how we approach assembling teams for our current mobile game productions. This article is now live on pocketgamer.biz: [article](http://www.pocketgamer.biz/comment-and-opinion/64296/4-keys-to-assembling-a-great-mobile-tech-team/)

### What can I expect?

We were facing the challenge of having ever smaller teams working highly effecient on mobile products in a technology new to them.

I am breaking our approach down into four key areas in this article:

* Strong team lead
* Senior and mentor
* Team mix
* Trust and empowerment

There even is footage of some of our upcoming games in there :)
I am looking forward for your feedback:
