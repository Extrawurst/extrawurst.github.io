Oh wow its more than a year since my last 'worthreading' :(
It was a crazy ride! Crazy hours at work, speaking at 4 conferences and 2 vacations later I am here now.
I tried to recollect the some discoveries since then:

### Talk: ACCU 2016 Keynote by Andrei Alexandrescu 

* c++ concepts
* sentinels
* Design by Introspection
* (re)invents fast partitioning algorithm

Andrei and his unique and entertaining way of doing presentations at prestigous ACCU 2016:

Here another link that is worth mentioning since Andrei is talking about it in his talk:

### Post: "Minimal Dev Setup on OXS" by Oliver Müller

This post was insanely useful to me, since it introduced me to (among a ton of other things) [brew-cask](https://caskroom.github.io/)

### Book: "Drive" by Daniel H. Pink

[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Daniel-H-Pink/dp/184767769X)

An amazing book, good overview of the current state of science about what motivates us. Historical catchup from Motiviation 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and now 3.0. I recommend this book for everyone leading people, working with people or if you just want to get a better understanding about yourself :)

### Book: "Elon Musk" by Ashlee Vance

[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/006230125X)

I was blown away by this story - admittedly I knew little about the details of Musk's life other than being this huge entrepeneur and founder of paypal, tesla and spaceX. This book really comes close convincing you that this guy is going to change the world (if he did not already) and sent us to mars.

### Post: "Public Speaking Transformed My Life…and Can Change Yours Too" by Cory House

A fascinating read about how to stop worrying and transforming into a public speaker. If you spoke on conferences already you will love to see parallels to what you experienced - if you have never tried it you will want to after reading this! Very inspiring.
