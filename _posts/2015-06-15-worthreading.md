Presentations by Scott Meyers are always entertaining. This one is kind of a meta presentation by him cause it is not 100% about c++ specifics (again) but about how to present to an expert audience, how to write a book and how to transport a message in a convincing and captivating way. And of course it shows yet again some c++ guts that only amazes :D
