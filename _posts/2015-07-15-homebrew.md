I recently made my first [homebrew]() contribution. homebrew is a package manager for osx much like yum/apt-get and the like you know from linux systems.
Since this may not be the last time I will elaborate what the workflow was to help me remember and others get a grip.

I am using the [freeimage library]() in  lot of my projects and since it turned out to be pretty hairy to build this lib on osx by hand I tried to find it in homebrew.
