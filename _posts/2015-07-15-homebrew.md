I recently made my first [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) contribution. homebrew is a package manager for osx much like yum/apt-get and the like you know from linux systems.
Since this may not be the last time I did this or have to do this I will elaborate what the workflow was.
This may help me remember and others get a grip how to do that the first time.

I am using the [freeimage library](http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/) in lot of my projects and since it turned out to be pretty hairy to build this lib on osx by hand I tried to find it in homebrew. 

Indeed homebrew has a formular for it:
[freeimage on homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/Freeimage)

### Updating a formular

Unfortunately the freeimage formular was a bit dated and just supported version 3.16.0.

Since I needed the most recent version I opened a ticket for version 3.17.0 on github: [issue #41609](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/41609).

@bfontaine suggested to do the update myself ;)

After looking into the [formular](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/freeimage.rb) of this version I tried to apply the patches to the src-download of freeimage by hand and found it working.

So the update was pretty streight forward using the [instructions for getting a pull request merged](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request-(and-get-it-merged).md#how-to-open-a-homebrew-pull-request-and-get-it-merged) for homebrew.

In the case of the freeimage update there were essentially four changes:

* update the download url
* update the version number
* update the file hash
* update the patches

### Updating the file hash

Here it got a little tricky, since the sourceforge download info just provided md5 or sha1 hashes.
A little googling later I had a working shell line to create the file hash in sha256:

{% highlight sh %}
shasum -a 256 FreeImage3170.zip
{% endhighlight %}

### Update the patching

This was the most work since the old patch did not work anymore because the makefiles of freeimage changed from 3.16.0 to 3.17.0.
So I created a copy of the targeted makefiles and applied the patches by hand and created the diff using git:

{% highlight sh %}
git diff Makefile.gnu p.Makefile.gnu > patch.diff
{% endhighlight %}

### TL;DR - The pull request

So the final change that got merged into homebrew to update the freeimage formular: [pull request #41619](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/41619/files)
