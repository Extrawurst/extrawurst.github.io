[In my last post](http://blog.extrawurst.org/programming/unity/general/2017/03/18/gdc2017.html) I already talked about the experience of talking at a big developer conference like GDC.

## GDC by the numbers

Two reasons why I checked the numbers for GDC:
1. I wanted to mention in this post how many speakers actually talk at GDC. 
2. GDC gives you a Deck of Cards if you speak at GDC: It features the best speakers of last year and I was curious how the odds are ;)

So I mentioned GDC aimed to get **27.000 visitors** in the beginning, right? Thats massive, but what is also massive is how many speakers they have.
I counted how many speakers are in there for latter 'A' through 'D' and it is 256 (give or take) that makes for an average of 66 per latter and that leads us to round about **1.500 speakers** overall.

Now I talked in the programming track and so I focused a little more on that and counted again. There were **150 programming talks** overall.
What caught my eye while counting those was the many presentation titles with the words "(presented by XYZ)" in the title. Turns out these are sponsored sessions - companies payed money to place that talk. So I counted again: **66 sponsored talks**. 
Now there are also a couple of 'Tutorials' and 'Roundtables' and leaving all of these out there were only **56 raw talks** left.

That made me humble actually because it means out of 56 non-sponsored programming session slots possible I got one! Wow!
