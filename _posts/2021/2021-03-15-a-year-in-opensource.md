# Time races

Exactly one year ago I commited the first version of [GitUI](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui) to Github. It's crazy how quickly the time past by and now we celebrate the first year anniversaryü•≥.

# Time to reflect

This project attracted way more attention than i anticipated and so I eventually found myself reviewing contributions by others‚ù§Ô∏è!

What a great feeling. This is why you publish something open source, right?

Well it is a two bladed sword: 
With every contributor you get a handful of issues and feature requests, some make sense, some are a interesting challenges, some are redicolous, some are just not important to you, still it is a good feeling to see your creation being noticed. 

You learn to say **no**. Well technically it is more like a *nice idea, not high up on my list though, contributions welcome* instead of *no*.

# What have I learned about open source?

My 10 most important take-aways:

0. Be nice and welcoming to everyone who contributes, even the smallest issue.
1. Provide a roadmap, so contributors can see the big picture.
2. Be prepared that people will try to fork away and think they can do better.
3. __Some__ users will think you just wait for them to file issues that you can fix for *them*.
4. There will be low times where stuff piles up - you learn to accept that instead of feeling pressured.
5. At times its tempting to accept a PR to finally move on - do not give in - keep a consistent quality standard.
6. This (5.) will annoy contributors that seek a quick'n'dirty *contributor* badge, but it is a good natural filter.
7. It is a collosal enjoyment to see first time contributors grow to be a reliable source of support.
8. No hard feelings when people leave again, do not finish their work, do not show ownership, loose interest.
9. Ask for help, it is surprising how humble-ness mobilizes people.
