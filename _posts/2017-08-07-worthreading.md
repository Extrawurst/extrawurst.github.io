The following stuff is what caught my eye in the last couple of weeks. Consider these kind of posts as an entry in my personal knowledge base ;)

In this installment I focus less on reading but on watching. These are particularly great talks/interviews that I watched over the course of the last few weeks. Very inspiring stuff:

### Video Lunch

Most of these Videos my team and I watched during lunch time. We do this every two weeks: Order in and watch a video in our office together. But I will devote a whole article on that later. Stay tuned..
